UltraBlock is advertisement blocking extension for Google Chrome. It works better if combined with AdBlock.

### What types of ads UltraBlock can remove

1. Ads on YouTube
2. In-video ads (by displaying a rectangle over ads)
3. Recommended videos on YouTube and all videos that are irrelevant to the currently playing video
4. Prevents websited from detecting that ads are removed
5. Bypasses url shorteners that display ads
6. Pop-ups and alerts
7. Google analytics and other tracking scripts
8. Website usage reporting scripts
9. Recommended articles, posts, images, etc
10. Enables selecting and copying protected content

### How it works

UltraBlock injects a certain script in webpages. The script then prepares the environment, overrides almost all built-in functions and controlls the execution of all webpages' scripts. Webpage content is not displayed until all ads are removed or prevented from appearing. Comparing to AdBlock, which is capable of removing about 80% of ads, UltraBlock is capable of removing about 99.9% of ads.

### Other features

This extension provides a way for downloading YouTube videos.
